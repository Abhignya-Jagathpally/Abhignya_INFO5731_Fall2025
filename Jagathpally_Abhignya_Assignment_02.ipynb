The main challenges were practical handling edge cases in cleaning, managing dependencies/models for parsing, and robustly paginating marketplace pages. The only significant pain point was Question 5 (Twitter/X): API access limits, token setup, and rate-limit workarounds required noticeably more time and resources than implied by the course forum guidance. Given that, the provided time felt appropriate for Q1–Q4 but tight once Q5’s overhead was included; extending the window or allowing a pre-provided dataset for Q5 would better match the expected effort."
